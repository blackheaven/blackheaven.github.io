        <section class="body"><p>Few weeks ago, I was talking to one of my co-workers about <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a>.</p>
<p>At some point, he was inquiring about retrospectives on migrating old systems
to event sourcing, benefits obtained, pitfalls to avoid, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I have looked around a bit, ask some friends, nothing relevant came up.</p>
<p>I'll try to summarize my 6+ years of experiences in this log.</p>
<h2 id="experiences">Experiences</h2>
<h3 id="distributed-mail-server">Distributed mail server</h3>
<p><em>Business context:</em> A FOSS company, providing a G-suit alternative.</p>
<p><em>Team context:</em> 6 seasoned SWE, already accustomed to software craftmanship,
DDD, and event sourcing.</p>
<p><em>Technical context:</em> it was a 10 years old Java project, mostly relying on
Cassandra, when I have joined, they were in the middle of a complete
modernization.</p>
<p><em>Challenges:</em> Solve concurrency issues, especially in the mailboxes area, most
of the bugs are in this area (race conditions occurs when a new e-mail were
incoming, while the user was working on them).</p>
<p><em>Event sourcing scope:</em> the mailboxes, very few events were involved.</p>
<p><em>Pitfalls:</em> the event sourcing implementation was quite complex and quite limited,
which means many of the operations were stateful, leading to a global state
permanently incoherent (e.g. two instances connected to the same Cassandra
cluster will has two distinct states). Add new events involved a lot of
boilerplate.</p>
<p><em>Benefits:</em> Mailboxes concurrency issues were fixed, the implementation was
comprehensive enough to have a lot of tools (debugging, rebuilding projections).</p>
<h3 id="shared-dashboard">Shared dashboard</h3>
<p><em>Business context:</em> A pre-seed startup looking for its product-market-fit.</p>
<p><em>Team context:</em> 4-people team, mostly juniors, discovering DDD.</p>
<p><em>Technical context:</em> A brown-field Haskell project I had started few months
ago, using AWS DynamoDB as primary data store.</p>
<p><em>Challenges:</em> The project was stressed by numerous changes. We also had to
figure out what the user was doing, especially when discovering new corner-cases
(also called business opportunities).</p>
<p><em>Event sourcing scope:</em> the whole organization, each "group" was in the
aggregate, alongside with users management, dashboards, etc. everything.</p>
<p><em>Pitfalls:</em> Team adoption was a huge pain point, most of them considered it
as a "waste", also, intents were missing (Commands should have been logged),
migration was done in big-bang mode (7-day effort), which created some tensions.
Keeping original projections in the discovery phase added burden without any
benefits.</p>
<p><em>Benefits:</em> Each new workflow or concept took only a few hours to implement
in the backend, events and commands where exposed in the API endpoints, new
events where pushed asynchronously.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-business-process">Distributed business process</h3>
<p><em>Business context:</em> A mature B2B company customer-focused with a very
comprehensive (yet adapting) business processes.</p>
<p><em>Team context:</em> 6-people team, mostly seniors, with some DDD/Event sourcing
knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Technical context:</em> 3 years project, microservice based, each of them had a
specific data/events store (EventStore, plain files, SQLite) and design discipline.</p>
<p><em>Challenges:</em> The business process was really complex (40 steps, 60 events),
constantly changing.</p>
<p><em>Event sourcing scope:</em> Only the regular, customer-facing process.</p>
<p><em>Pitfalls:</em> Each microservice had their own events, trying to integrate
each-other events, loosing information along the way, events were also rigid,
no event could be added easily, or modified, or the stream rewrote. Most of the
computation were done around a single stream, projections being computed at
startup (45 minutes). While only few things were outside the system, but it
was the missing piece to have a stable stream.
Every microservice were involved in new features.
A big events re-design was planed, but never implemented.</p>
<p><em>Benefits:</em> Each microservice had their own events, giving a lot of flexibility,
limited changes (such as new projections) were easy.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Events shouldn't be set in stone (they aim to evolved, be updated, deprecated, rewritten)</li>
<li>Big bang rewrites are bad, but incomplete migrations are harmful</li>
<li>Big aggregates are okay, in the literature, aggregates should have few events, in practice, big aggregates are better than a lot of smaller ones involving synchronization</li>
<li>Focus on developer experience, focus on tooling and easiness to add events</li>
<li>Don't focus on projections, they could be added later, if they are really popular and critical</li>
</ul>
