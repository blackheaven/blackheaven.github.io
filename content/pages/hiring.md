I am *Gautier DI FOLCO* working as *Staff Software Engineer / Senior Haskell developer*
@ [LivTours](https://github.com/livtours) (see more in [about](@/pages/about.md) /
[my resume](/DIFOLCOGautierCurriculumVitaeEnTech.pdf)).

While I am not currently actively looking for a new position, I am open to new
opportunities (I'll probably look for a new one in the upcoming months).

Here is what you can [expect from me](@/blog/2024-01-21_readme.md).

Here is what I expect from new positions.

* Fully remote (although I'm ready to travel from time to time for in-person events)
* Full time position (40 hours) with real flexible work hours (see note 1)
* An annual gross salary €72.500 for 5 weeks vacations (see note 2, note 3 and note 4)
* Being able to work on my operating system (NixOS) and on my IDE (NeoViM)
* Work as software engineer (whatever the level) or technical leader (if it involves management, be sure I'm not the top manager)
* Even though I'm currently specialized in Haskell, I'm open to any technologies (I already worked in Rust, Nix, Scala, Java, TypeScript, C, etc.)

Note 1: I have weekly appointments on regular CET/CEST working hours
(currently Monday and Wednesday mornings),
so I need to be able to work outside the regular 9-5.
Otherwise, I don't mind work part-time (4/5).

Note 2: this amount is precise and set by the French government, it is bound by
the freelancer administrative status (named "auto entrepreneur", "*self-employed*"),
beyond €72.500 yearly I have to switch to "EURL", which have higher taxes
(to have the same net salary I should earn €105.000).

Note 3: In France I have 35 days of paid vacations and 11 national holidays,
however I rarely take more than 4 weeks of vacations each year.

Note 4: Salaries may vary from countries to countries, but in March 2024,
the results of my research are (average base gross salary in K€):
