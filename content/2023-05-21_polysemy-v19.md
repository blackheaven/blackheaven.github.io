Things have evolved since the beginning of this series!

Polysemy had two major releases: `1.8.0.0` and `1.9.0.0`.

Not a lot of things have evolved, but we can notice few things:

* `withLowerToIO` and all the related interpreters (`asyncToIO`, `lowerAsync`, `lowerEmbed`, etc.) have been removed
* `Polysemy.View` has been dropped
* `Scoped` and `Opaque` effects have been introduced

The only change we had to make in our codebase was to change:

```haskell
withLowerToIO $ \lower _ ->
  withResponse req $ \_ -> lower act
```

to:

```haskell
withWeavingToFinal @IO $ \initialState lower _ ->
  withResponse req $ \_ -> lower $ act <$ initialState
```

We'll review new effects in next logs.
