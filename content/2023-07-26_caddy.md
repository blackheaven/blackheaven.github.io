At some point in my previous position we had to set up live updates (i.e. getting changes without reloading the page) in our SPA.

Instead of relying on [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
I have chosen [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) as I was much simpler (as it is unidirectional)
while perfectly fitting our use-cases.

Instead of building ours, we relied on [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks/), which itself relies on [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
which is a "new" HTTP server.

While you don't really need to know it to have something working, we had come concerns which forced me to dig a little deeper, this log is about some snippets I collected.

The first awesome thing with `Caddy` is its dynamical configuration.

Which means, once it runs (`caddy run`), this command is enough to change the configuration:

```
$ curl localhost:2019/load \
    -H "Content-Type: text/caddyfile" \
    --data-binary @Caddyfile
```

So, with a simple definition:

```
http://localhost:8080 {
	respond "Hello, world!"
}
```

(`http://` here forces HTTP protocol, `Caddy` if HTTPS by default)

We get

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080
Hello, world!
```

To be transparent, it often ends up in:

```
while inotifywait -e close_write Caddyfile test.sh; do ./test.sh; done
```

`test.sh` containing the load `curl` and the `curl`s I want to test.

`Caddy` gives you the opportunity to quickly create a reverse proxy:

```
http://localhost:8081 {
  reverse_proxy :8080
}
```

You can be more specific adding requests matchers:

```
http://localhost:8081 {
 reverse_proxy /api/* :8080
 reverse_proxy /assets/* :8082
}
```

or having named matchers:

```
http://localhost:8081 {
  @api_ro {
    method GET
    path /api/*
  }

 reverse_proxy @api_ro :8083
 reverse_proxy /api/* :8080
 reverse_proxy /assets/* :8082
}
```

Since I was running everything in kubernetes, I had to have a `/healthz` endpoint to ensure container readiness/liveness:

```
http://localhost:8080 {
  respond /healthz 200
}
```

At some point I also needed specific reverse proxy on another subdomain, involving [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

```
(cors) {
    @origin{args.0} header Origin {args.0}
    header @origin{args.0} Access-Control-Allow-Headers "content-type, x-requested-with"
    header @origin{args.0} Vary Origin
}

localhost:8080 {
    log
    encode zstd gzip

    import cors https://app.acme.crp
    import cors https://backoffice.acme.crp

    handle /healthz {
        respond 200
    }

    handle /api {
        rewrite * /v2/api
        reverse_proxy https://backend.product.com {
            header_up X-Real-IP {remote}
        }
    }
```

As you can see, you can easily factor-out directives.

I also use it extensively to prototype APIs (instead of Postman-like tools), as it allows me to have a mocked API code-first.
