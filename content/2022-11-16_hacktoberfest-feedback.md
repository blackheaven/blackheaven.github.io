Following [my Hacktoberfest participation](@/2022-11-13_hacktoberfest-contributions.md), I had the chance to have a variety contribution of experiences.

## Pendings PRs

I'm always a bit sad whenever my PR don't get comments, but it's the life of projects, they depend of their maintainers priorities.

However, I get confused sometimes when direction changes.

## Outdated PRs

This one is really frustrating, you start some contribution, they stale for a while and suddenly, another PR is pushed and merged in few hours.

However, I came across an interesting situation where my PR raised a number of concerns, starting a new set feature.
Even though I didn't get something merged, raising the discussion was a good way to contribute.

## Accepted PRs

While I like to get my PRs merged, I've found myself it three cases:

* My PR got merged without discussion: I think it's quite damaging since the maintainers will rework it after the merge, so I didn't get the opportunity to learn
* Some discussions happen, changes are requested: I really enjoy this kind of PRs, I have the chance to debate, to talk to the maintainers, learn about the projet and its spirit
* The discussion takes place over days, direction changes, maintainers do not take the time to articulate their request: it's particulary complicated to work on a project with moving objectives, but it's even harder when objective are given based on a wrong context or once a week
