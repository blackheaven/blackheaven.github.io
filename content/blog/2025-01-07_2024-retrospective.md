2024 was an intense year, let's do a quick retrospective.

Regarding this website:

* Despite my [10 weeks break](@/blog/2024-03-24_streak.md) and a pace slow down, I have written *53* logs in 2024 vs *105* in 2023
  * I have started two series:
    + [Haskell legacy](@/blog/2024-07-09_api-legacy-introduction.md)
    + [Extreme branchless](@/blog/2024-10-29_extreme-branchess-1.md)
* I have added a [Talks page](@/pages/talks.md)

Also, in my [break log](@/blog/2024-03-24_streak.md), I've mentioned,
few objectives:

* _Restart my Yoga practice_
  * I didn't find a regular time to practice
* _Learn a new natural language: I have started German for ZuriHac since few weeks, I'll try to pick an eight one by the end of the year_
  * I've revised my Swedish, but I didn't focus on it
* _Learn new programming languages: this year I have learned Lua and Rust (with a strong emphasis as I plan to change focus), I plan to learn Verse and Unison_
  * Same thing
* _Refocus my career: I think my career is currently good, but I aim to reach the next level (few years ago I had rejected an offer from a Big Tech, I have some remorse, being part of a Big Tech is still on my bucket list), that's why I will:_
  + _Regularly do leetcode challenges (I have done 3 exercises every week since the beginning of the year), in Rust_
    + I've completed roughly 200 challenges
  + _Regularly train on system design on article and mock interview per week_
    + I've read 2-3 system design articles pers week
  + _Work on my leadership skills (I have filled my RSS subscription with this topic, I still have to find an efficient way to train)_
    + I've read 3-4 leaderships articles per week
  + _Attempt [Coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) in Rust_
    + I've attempted many challenges, it was a [great move](@/blog/2024-10-15_coding-challenges.md)

Something less visible on this site:

* [I have changed job](@/blog/2024-09-03_autogriff-restrospective.md), going from employee to freelancer (administratively speaking)
* I have spent a lot of time optimizing my workflow/setup
* I have changed my homelab ca log will be dedicated to thatc
* I have made 23 [FOSS contributions](@/pages/foss.md)

I have no particular plans for 2025, however, I plan to:

* Keep writing one log per week
  * At the moment of writing, I have planed 18 logs
    * 5 are written
    * 4 more have the underneath material done
    * 6 more have a definite layout
* Keep doing code kata
* Continue to learn about Rust
