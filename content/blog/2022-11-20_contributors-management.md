I learned a lot during [my Hacktoberfest participation](@/blog/2022-11-16_hacktoberfest-feedback.md), especially how I like my contributions to be handled.

Here are some guidelines:

* Write clear issues: the context, where to start in the code, some suggestions on the design
* Give precise review: don't only give an overall feedback of the code, point piece of code and give fix examples
* Be consistent in your requests
* Review the surrounding code when you make a comment (the code may have changed since the last time you had a look at it)
* Try to be regular or considerate when you answer
